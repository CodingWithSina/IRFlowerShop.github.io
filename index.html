            <p>
                A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae,
                or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands
                of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing,
                or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.

            <b>Why can the smell of flowers make you happy?</b>
            Sticking your nose in a bouquet bursting with aromas and scents can lift the spirits and the soul whilst
            also transporting you outside. The scent of flowers has long been an inspiration and ingredient for perfumes
            & beauty products, and these scents can instantly take us to other places, evoking people and memories. For
            me the heady scent of sweetpeas transports me instantly back to my grannies house, filling me with nostaglic
            and happy thoughts. What is it really that gives you that lift when you take a whiff of some blooms??? We
            wanted to take a deeper look at the chemical effect and benefits that some of these floral scents can have
            on your brain.
